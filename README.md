# DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure
This course covers the engineering and design of IT infrastructure, focusing on cloud-scale distributed systems and modern DevOps practices. IT infrastructure deployment practices are rapidly changing as organizations build infrastructure as code and adopt cloud computing platforms. This course examines the theory behind these modern practices and the real-world implementation challenges faced by IT organizations. 
While the lessons will cover a number of theoretical concepts, we will primarily learn by doing. Students will gain hands-on experience with several widely-adopted IT platforms including GitHub, AWS, and Docker. 
## Course Objective
- Understand how IT organizations are deploying modern infrastructure and how to build infrastructure as code. 
- Understand how to architect cloud-scale distributed systems and the key design patterns used to enhance scalability and reliability within these systems. 
- Develop specific skills related to DevOps practices including source control management, package management, and configuration management.
